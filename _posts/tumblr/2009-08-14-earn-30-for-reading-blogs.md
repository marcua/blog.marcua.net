[Michael Bernstein](http://people.csail.mit.edu/msbernst/) and I are working on a project that we will release to the public soon. First, we want to make sure it does what we think it will, so we’re running a user study.

We’re looking for Google Reader users to try out a new extension that helps you share interesting items with people you know. E-mail the FeedMe team at [feedme@csail.mit.edu](mailto:feedme@csail.mit.edu) to participate!

If you are: a Firefox user who uses Google Reader regularly (addicts are welcome!)  
You can get: a $30 gift card for using our Google Reader extension at least every other day, for two weeks  
We are: an MIT computer science research team  
Dates of the study: preferably Tuesday, August 18 to Tuesday, September 1

E-mail [feedme@csail.mit.edu](mailto:feedme@csail.mit.edu) if you’re interested. Follow your feeds while you help science!
