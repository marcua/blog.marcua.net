At some point this summer my awesome old roommate A.J. and girlfriend Meredith decided to take a trip to India. We’ll be leaving this Friday and hanging out for 19 days. A.J. is leaving after 15, at which point Meredith and I will hang out in [Goa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goa)—probably the only relaxing part of our trip. Luckily, with the help of information technology (namely, [this](http://www.acer.com/aspireone/) netbook), we’ll be documenting the trip on this blog.

While the trip became the impetus for this blog, I’ve wanted a more dynamic space on the web for a long time now, so I’m happy to finally have a place to keep my thoughts.
