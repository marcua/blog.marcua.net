Life update: I’ve defended my thesis and I’m now the Director of Data at [Locu](https://locu.com/). &nbsp;This doesn’t change much on the blog, as I’ll still periodically update it with random thoughts. &nbsp;I’m also doing a bit of blogging on the Locu blog on topics like [our technology workflow](http://blog.locu.com/post/25389032496/the-locu-workflow-a-crawler-a-learner-and-a-crowd), [designing for crowds](http://blog.locu.com/post/33643615645/crowd-task-decomposition-how-locu-breaks-it-down-for), and the [human side of crowdsourcing](http://blog.locu.com/post/34787851747/the-human-side-of-crowdsourcing).

It’s an exciting and very different next step for me. &nbsp;I’m still very excited about introducing new students to data and computer science, and will keep that up as well.
