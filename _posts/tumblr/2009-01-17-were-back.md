Though a little jetlagged, we’re all back. Sorry for the lack of liveness to the blog updates—it wound up being quite difficult to access the internet at the hotels we were staying at, and A.J. and I once even tried to find a cybercafe at night to no avail (after wandering Udaipur in the dark for an hour).

I have some diary-style content queued up, but decided that keeping a day-by-day diary is less interesting than writing entries on the most interesting topics (driving, food, etc.) on the trip. As such, I’ll post the stuff I’ve written, then add a single entry summarizing our itinerary as it ended up, and then move on to “interesting topics” posts from then on.
