By way of [danah boyd](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/04/21/what_are_your_i.html) I found the [Knight Commission on the Information Needs of Communities](http://www.pbs.org/engage/publicinput), which published an [introductory whitepaper](http://www.pbs.org/engage/publicinput/white-paper) that asks how local communities find, digest, and react to information.

Outside of designing software, my biggest hobby is reading the news, so you would imagine that I would feel well equipped to answer how I keep up-to-date with, and respond to, local events. Reading the questions the commission is tackling gave me pause, however, since I realized that all of my sources tell me how things are _over there_, and very little about what’s going on _around here_. I keep up-to-date with the people who live next door, but only by way of the abstracted and aggregated views of the national news media.

I have tried to sign up for blogs about my area, but they are either too commercialized, or have a low signal-to-noise ratio. And even then, if Hurricane Katrina strikes the northeast, I’ll know as little today about what to do next as I assume most people did the first time disaster struck.

So the national news tells us about _there_. Blogs tell us about _what we know we want_. Twitter tells us about _now_. Where do we find out about _down the street_, _at the moment_, and _what everyone is doing about it_? It seems that we’ve built a digital infrastructure to maximize information gathering at the expense of a local infrastructure for dealing with the more basic things in life.
