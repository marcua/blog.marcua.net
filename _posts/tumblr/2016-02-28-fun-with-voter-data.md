Since elections are on everyoneâ€™s mind, I played around with some voter data. Your name/address/phone/party affiliation/participation is available in public voter data. I created an example of how it can be used in a [Jupyter/IPython notebook](https://github.com/marcua/funwithdata/blob/master/electiondata/voter_records.ipynb).

This was my first use of Jupyter notebooks to write a data analysis piece. It was a lot of fun, and I hope all of you do it too!

Some fun findings: 1) two 115-year-old active voters, and 2) an example of how a campaign can create a call/mailing list of active voters to ask them for additional help.

Thanks to [Meredith Blumenstock](http://meredithblumenstock.com/) and [Derek Willis](https://twitter.com/derekwillis) for reading an early draft of this!
