Sorry for lack of update. It’s surprisingly hard to get an internet connection in our hotels, and getting a cybercafe is harder than you think if you’re traveling all day. A.J. and I made two attempts at night (one took over an hour) and turned back without luck.

Either way - we’re happy and taking it easy in Udaipur before taking a train back to Delhi tonight.

I’ve been batching up some writing, but was attacked by Traveler’s Diarrhea (Delhi Belly), and lost the energy to type. Updates will follow - hopefully we have more luck with internet! There is too much to see and experience for me to copy edit these entries, so excuse editing mistakes you find. This experience will be write-only for me.
