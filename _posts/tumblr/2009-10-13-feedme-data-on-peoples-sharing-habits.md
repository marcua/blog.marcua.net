[Michael](http://people.csail.mit.edu/msbernst) and I have a blog post [Over on the Haystack Blog](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/haystack/blog/2009/10/13/feedme-understanding-and-supporting-social-link-sharing-on-the-web/) describing some work we’ve been doing in studying how people share news and blog posts with each other through e-mail and other social networking tools.

So far, we’re posting findings from surveys, but soon we’ll give you a double-whammy: we plan on announcing what we found through a user study of a tool called FeedMe designed to help with sharing in Google Reader, and release FeedMe for everyone to use.

Stay tuned. Until then, take a look at the [technical report](http://hdl.handle.net/1721.1/49426) for the juicy details!
