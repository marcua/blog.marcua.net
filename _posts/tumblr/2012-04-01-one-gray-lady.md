I consume content through many aggregators, but [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) (_The Gray Lady_) is the single source of content I go to directly at least daily to know what’s happening in the world. While it’s good for news, what sets _The Times_ apart from other content sources is its depth of reporting. There’s one problem, though: by default, longer NYT articles do not appear in _Single Page_ mode. This has caused me problems in the past, ranging in severity from slightly annoying (having to click _Next Page_) to pretty frustrating (loading articles for offline reading only to realize I only had the first page).

So I created [One Gray Lady](https://github.com/marcua/onegraylady), a Greasemonkey plugin that loads all NYT content in single page mode.

To install it in Google Chrome or Firefox with the Greasemonkey plugin, [click here](https://github.com/marcua/onegraylady/raw/master/onegraylady.user.js).

I have only tested the code in Chrome, and while I did a bit of testing on various URLs, I’m sure I missed something. Feel free to send updates or suggestions!
