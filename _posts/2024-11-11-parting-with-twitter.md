For many reasons, it's time for me to leave X/Twitter. I haven't been
meaningfully active on the platform for a while now, using it largely
to boost company announcements and otherwise trying to rebuild my
social network on Mastodon and Bluesky. But now even that restricted
use case feels irresponsible. We have to pick which companies and
products deserve the privilege of our attention, and for me, X has not
been one of those companies for a while.

I'm nostalgic for what Twitter was, and many of my friends are still
only/largely on the network. I want to keep in touch with each of
you. We can keep in touch via
[Mastodon](https://hachyderm.io/@marcua),
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/marcua.net), or [over
email](mailto:marcua@marcua.net). I'll also try to blog more.

As for the account itself, I'm torn between deleting it and keeping it
locked down so no one can squat the handle. I'll iterate on what I end
up doing, but plan to log out/delete it on all of my devices and avoid
links to the platform except in urgent situations. I hope that with
time, the number of important/urgent announcements that can only be
found on X become negligible. The technology to prevent the
centralized control of social networks exists, and we owe it to
society to rely more on those technologies and less on other people's
property.
