In 2020, I spent too much time doomscrolling and otherwise distracted
by the world. As a result, I spent less time reading/listening to
books. I continued the [2019 approach of reading from the Pulitzer
Prize list]({% post_url 2021-01-10-2019-book-list %}) and relied on
some excellent recommendations from friends.

Here are the books I read or listened to in 2020 in the order that I
consumed them:
