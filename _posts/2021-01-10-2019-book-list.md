In 2019, I reconnected with books. This is largely thanks to
[Libby](https://help.libbyapp.com/en-us/6103.htm), the app that made
it easy to check out and read books, and the [New York Public
Library](https://www.nypl.org/library-card), from which I got a free
card.

I did a mix of reading and listening to books, largely listening to
one while I ran and did chores, and reading one at night and on
weekends. Libby/your library probably give you access to a bunch of
e-books and audiobooks, so give both a shot!

Here are the books I read or listened to in 2019 in the order that I
consumed them. After a few warmup/fun books, I started reading books
from the [Pulitzer prize
list](https://www.pulitzer.org/prize-winners-categories) for previous
years in a bunch of the book subcategories, as well as recommendations
from friends.
