*Quick reminder: [ayb](https://github.com/marcua/ayb) makes it easy to create databases, share them with collaborators, and query them from a web application or the command line. I've been working on it for a few years, and am newly pushing myself to more publicly discuss releases, so here goes!*

I'm excited to share v0.1.10 of ayb, which, in addition to [a few quality-of-life improvements](https://github.com/marcua/ayb/releases/tag/v0.1.10), introduces Docker images to make it easy to try and deploy `ayb`.

While [the full details on how to use ayb Docker images are in the documentation](https://github.com/marcua/ayb#docker), here's a high-level introduction. To pull the latest version of the image:
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/marcua/ayb
```

You can then create an alias for convenience:
```bash
alias ayb="docker run --network host ghcr.io/marcua/ayb ayb"
```

To run the server, you'll need to create an `ayb.toml` configuration file (see [Running a server](https://github.com/marcua/ayb#running-a-server)), create a data directory for the databases, and map the configuration and data directory as volumes when running the container. For example:
```bash
docker run -v $(pwd)/ayb.toml:/ayb.toml \
          -v $(pwd)/ayb_data:/ayb_data \
          -p 5433:5433 \
          ghcr.io/marcua/ayb \
          ayb server --config /ayb.toml
```

Then use the client as normal:
```bash
ayb client --url http://127.0.0.1:5433 register marcua you@example.com
```

That's it! One command to run a server, and one to run a client!

In shipping Docker support, I got to play with two new-to-me features:
1. So that a new image can be automatically built and pushed every time a new version is tagged, I created a GitHub Action that triggers on any new `vX.Y.Z` tag, builds the image, pushes it to the GitHub Docker image repository, and tags the image appropriately. The [action's code](https://github.com/marcua/ayb/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-on-tag.yml) shows just how much tooling exists to make this simple.  
2. This was my first time using multi-stage builds in Docker ([check out `FROM ... AS builder` in the Dockerfile](https://github.com/marcua/ayb/blob/b81791129529768db884e03823157ced10752068/Dockerfile#L3)) to first create an image with the dependencies to build the project, and then to create the second image with just the binaries users will need to run `ayb`. The first container with all of the build tooling takes up ~2.7GB, whereas the container with the binaries takes up only ~150MB, which makes for a way faster `docker pull` and is way kinder to users' machines and bandwidth. 

One annoying limitation is that at the moment, only `linux-amd64` images are built due to [some bugs I encountered in building `linux-arm64`](https://github.com/marcua/ayb/issues/523). Reach out or leave a comment on that PR if you need a `linux-arm64` image.
