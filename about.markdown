I'm the Co-Founder and CTO of <a href="https://b12.io">B12</a>, where
we're building a better future of creative and analytical work. Before
that, I was Director of Data at <a href="http://locu.com">Locu</a>, a
startup that was acquired by GoDaddy.  I went to grad school at MIT's
CSAIL.  One time in Jerusalem I ate a whole tub of hummus on my own.
I don't regret that day.
